THIS LOG CONTAINS INFORMATION ON THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT

25/09/25
Meeting to discuss the project further. Some things that must be considered to have a complete model:
- What probability of merging should I assign?
- How do we make time evolve?
- How do we implement breaking apart of the bonds?
- System must satisfy detailed balance.

We decided to start off by simulating a simple system with 4 vertices, 3 of which are connected. I will also try to find a way to visualize the code as it evolves in time.
