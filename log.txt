THIS LOG CONTAINS INFORMATION ON THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT

25/09/25
TITLE: Meeting to set the project.
Meeting to discuss the project further. Some things that must be considered to have a complete model:
- What probability of merging should I assign?
- How do we make time evolve?
- How do we implement breaking apart of the bonds?
- System must satisfy detailed balance.

We decided to start off by simulating a simple system with 4 vertices, 3 of which are connected. I will also 
try to find a way to visualize the code as it evolves in time.

TITLE: Simulation with simplest model.
Made a simulation of the random attachment model with a very simple graph with 4 vertices, 3 edges, and 3 copies. 
The way I conceived of visualizing the progression of the simulation is to draw a graph that joins together the elements
of each component. There are still things I want to clarify, such as why we treat the vertices as distinguishable, how
I should go about sampling edges (because right now the simulation just goes through a list with a set order until it finds
the right one), and how to keep track of time.

TITLE: Meeting on simple model simulation.
Meeting to discuss the simulation with the simplest model. Things talked about:
- Is the algorithm already sampling edges uniformly? (can check/prove myself)
- How to update time such that the rate equations are satisfied?
    - Two alternatives: can always update or only update time when successful in sampling an edge.
- Task: reading up on Stochastic Simulation Algorithms (SSAs).

08/10/25
TITLE: Meeting on SSAs.
Discussed the paper on how to model reaction processes with SSAs. Decided that it is a priority to understand how
these algorithms work and that I should spend some time doing this.

23/10/25
TITLE: Discussing SSAs and convergence to deterministic rate equations.
Talked about the convergence of the expectation of the number of particles in a species converges to the deterministic rate equations.
Decided it was time to start simulating SSA with small system.

28/10/25
TITLE: Convergence in expectation.
I tried showing that the expectation of the number of species converges to the deterministic rate equation. That is, for the
reaction A + B <-> C:

dE[A]/dt = koff * C - kon * E[AB]

This is very close to the result I wanted to show. The only thing I would need is E[AB] = E[A]E[B].

29/10/25
TITLE: Implementation of simple SSA.
Today I implemented the SSA in two simple systems. Once has 2 species that can form pairs. The other
has 4 and it can also only form pairs. I noticed that the initial conditions for the number of 
species seemed to play a rather large role, especially compared with the rate. I'd like to solve the 
deterministic rate equations to see how my results compare.

13/11/25
TITLE: Checking convergence of SSA to deterministic equations.
I wanted to check that the SSA for the 2-square actually converged to the deterministic rate equations.
To do this, I solved the system of 3 equations by noticing that because we are working in the Canonical
Ensemble, the total number of particles is always constant (nA+nAB and nB+nAB). This allowed me to 
analytically solve the ODEs, and upon plotting them I was able to observe that indeed the SSA followed
the expected behaviour.

20/11/25
TITLE: Assembly of the 4-square.
Extended the implementation to complete the assembly of the 4-square. It is difficult because
there are a lot more equations to consider now. It appears as if everything is working correctly,
but I still need to check convergence to the deterministic equations to ensure everything is fine.

25/11/25
TITLE: Improving the 4-square.
Solved the deterministic ODEs to check the 4-square system. Added a new way of visualizing the
progress of the simulation: bar charts showing the proportion of species that have been formed
so far.

27/11/25
TITLE: All forward experiment.
Ran the experiment where all on rates are 1, and no backwards reactions are allowed. To better
understand the result of this system (proportion of 4-square is about 0.5), ran some analysis
on a simplified set of ODEs to describe this system.

04/12/25
TITLE: Adding statistics.
Added a script that can run the simulation multiple times and extract statistics. To make sure 
the set of time points we take is the same, we interpolate.

11/12/25
TITLE: Only-forward ODEs.
I fixed the ODEs for the only-forward experiment. The issue was that I forgot to account for
the fact that there are four of each M, D, T species, and only one T.

12/01/26
TITLE: Error propagation and proportions as a function of system size.
Fixed how I propagated the error bars for the proportions bar chart. Added a script to simulate
the proportions of each group as a function of system size.

17/01/26
TITLE: Detailed balance and code refactoring.
Fixed the rates to ensure detailed balance is satisfied. Refactored to code base to abstract
functionality and make it easier to change global parameters in the data.
