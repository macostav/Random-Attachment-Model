THIS LOG CONTAINS INFORMATION ON THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT

25/09/25
TITLE: Meeting to set the project.
Meeting to discuss the project further. Some things that must be considered to have a complete model:
- What probability of merging should I assign?
- How do we make time evolve?
- How do we implement breaking apart of the bonds?
- System must satisfy detailed balance.

We decided to start off by simulating a simple system with 4 vertices, 3 of which are connected. I will also 
try to find a way to visualize the code as it evolves in time.

TITLE: Simulation with simplest model.
Made a simulation of the random attachment model with a very simple graph with 4 vertices, 3 edges, and 3 copies. 
The way I conceived of visualizing the progression of the simulation is to draw a graph that joins together the elements
of each component. There are still things I want to clarify, such as why we treat the vertices as distinguishable, how
I should go about sampling edges (because right now the simulation just goes through a list with a set order until it finds
the right one), and how to keep track of time.

TITLE: Meeting on simple model simulation.
Meeting to discuss the simulation with the simplest model. Things talked about:
- Is the algorithm already sampling edges uniformly? (can check/prove myself)
- How to update time such that the rate equations are satisfied?
    - Two alternatives: can always update or only update time when successful in sampling an edge.
- Task: reading up on Stochastic Simulation Algorithms (SSAs).

08/10/25
TITLE: Meeting on SSAs.
Discussed the paper on how to model reaction processes with SSAs. Decided that it is a priority to understand how
these algorithms work and that I should spend some time doing this.

23/1025
TITLE: Discussing SSAs and convergence to deterministic rate equations.
Talked about the convergence of the expectation of the number of particles in a species converges to the deterministic rate equations.
Decided it was time to start simulating SSA with small system.
